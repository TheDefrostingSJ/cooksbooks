Cook's Books

Cook's Books (no idea if name is taken) is a recipe database
and data management application.

Hopes:

- CB will track what groceries you purchase, to recommend recipes using
partial portions / leftover ingrediants before they expire!

-- CB will allow the user to rank recipes, and recommend dishes similar to
highly ranked dishes
